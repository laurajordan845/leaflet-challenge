# leaflet-challenge
Module 15 Challenge for Laura Jordan

## Description
The United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short, is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.

The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. In this challenge, I have been tasked with developing a way to visualize USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.

## Earthquake Visualization
I was tasked with creating a visualization of the earthquake dataset. I had to retrieve the geoJSON file, import the information and then use Leaflet to create a mapthat plots all of the earthquakes within the past month. The data markers on the map to show where the earthquake occurred reflect both the magnitude and depth of the earthquake. Additionally, when you click on the marker, you can see additional information on the earthquake.

## Support
I attended class, reviewed my notes, used the additional resource links provided in the class activities and did a ton of online research to complete this challenge assignment.

## Submission Includes -- STILL NEED TO UPDATE WITH INFORMATION
* static/js folder which has the app.js file with my code
* index.html with the HTML code
* samples.json is the file with the initial dataset
